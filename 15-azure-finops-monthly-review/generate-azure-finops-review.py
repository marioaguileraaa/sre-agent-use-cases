# generate-azure-finops-review
# Python tool for Azure SRE Agent: classic monthly FinOps review of the whole Azure environment.
# Sources (all read-only): Cost Management Query API (3 queries per subscription), Consumption budgets,
# Azure Resource Graph (resource groups and tags, idle and orphaned resources, Azure Advisor cost recommendations).
# READ ONLY. The SRE Agent managed identity needs Reader on the configured subscriptions (or management group);
# Reader includes cost and budget reads at subscription scope (Cost Management Reader is the cost-only alternative).
# It never creates, modifies or deletes anything, and adds no Azure cost (no exports, storage or Log Analytics).
# BEFORE PASTING IT into the Builder, replace <YOUR_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID> and <YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID> in the
# CONFIGURE block. A Client ID or a Subscription ID is not a secret. operation=self_test needs no configuration.
# Version 1.0 - November 2026
