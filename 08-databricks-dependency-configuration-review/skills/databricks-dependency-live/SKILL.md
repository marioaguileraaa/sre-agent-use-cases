# Azure Databricks dependency and configuration review

Use ONLY `generate-databricks-dependency-report`. The operator must explicitly
select that one tool and this skill for `databricks-dependency-live`; no
inherited tools, shell, exec, generic Python, SQL execution tools, remediation
connectors or role-grant tools.

## Scope, cross-tenant identity and evidence boundaries

The code contains fixed administrator constants: `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`,
`SRE_TENANT_ID`, `TARGET_TENANT_ID`, `MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, optional
`FEDERATED_APP_CLIENT_ID`, optional `KEYVAULT_OAUTH_SECRET_URI`, and the
`APPROVED_WORKSPACES` allowlist. Tool parameters cannot change credentials,
tenants, workspace hosts, endpoints, SQL/KQL queries, filesystem paths, billing
scopes or resource IDs.

- If the fixed configuration still contains `<PLACEHOLDER>` values, the tool
  stops before any authentication or network call with `status="error"` and
  `error.code="configuration_required"` (`artifact_status="not_written"`).
- If `SRE_TENANT_ID != TARGET_TENANT_ID` and `auth_mode == "same_tenant_uami"`,
  the tool stops before authentication with
  `error.code="cross_tenant_configuration_required"`. A single-tenant SRE UAMI
  in Tenant A never automatically obtains Tenant B tokens or Databricks
  workspace permissions.
- Keep **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) control plane** (`management.azure.com`)
  strictly separate from the **Azure Databricks Workspace & Unity Catalog REST
  plane** (`https://adb-<id>.<shard>.azuredatabricks.net`). Azure Lighthouse
  delegation projects ARM RBAC only; it does not grant Databricks Workspace or
  Unity Catalog access.
- Supported cross-tenant modes are:
  1. `cross_tenant_multitenant_fic`: Multi-tenant Entra App Registration in the
     SRE tenant trusting the SRE UAMI via Federated Identity Credential
     (`api://AzureADTokenExchange`) and provisioned as a Service Principal in
     the target tenant for both ARM and Databricks (`2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d/.default`).
  2. `cross_tenant_lighthouse_plus_databricks_oidc`: Azure Lighthouse for ARM
     reads plus Databricks Service Principal Federation Policy (`/oidc/v1/token`
     RFC 8693 `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` with
     `client_id`, `subject_token`, `subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`,
     `scope=all-apis`) for Workspace/Unity Catalog REST reads.
  3. `cross_tenant_lighthouse_plus_keyvault_oauth_m2m`: Azure Lighthouse for ARM
     reads plus in-memory OAuth M2M secret resolution from an approved Key Vault
     in the SRE tenant using the SRE UAMI (`https://vault.azure.net/.default`).

Use `operation="list_workspaces"` with other defaults to list the fixed
operator-configured roster without authentication or network access. This
roster is configuration metadata, not proof that a workspace exists, is
reachable or authorizes reads.

## Deep dependency mapping contract (`OBSERVED` vs `INFERRED` vs `UNKNOWN`)

Every dependency node, edge and blind spot carries an explicit
`classification`:

- **`OBSERVED`**: Exact native ID or key join verified across collected API
  responses (`job_task.depends_on`, `job_task.existing_cluster_id`,
  `job_task.job_cluster_key`, `job_task.pipeline_id`, `job_task.warehouse_id`,
  `job_task.run_job_id`, `cluster.policy_id`, `cluster.instance_pool_id`,
  `uc_external_location.credential_name`,
  `uc_storage_credential.access_connector_id`,
  `secret_scope.keyvault_metadata.resource_id`, `dlt_pipeline.catalog`/`target`,
  and ARM `customVirtualNetworkId`, `accessConnector.id`,
  `managedResourceGroupId`, `outboundNetworkDependenciesEndpoints`).
- **`INFERRED`**: Explicit URI or hostname reference in configuration where the
  target Azure resource detail was not collected in ARM (for example, an
  `abfss://container@account.dfs.core.windows.net` external location or CMK
  `keyVaultUri` whose target storage account or Key Vault is outside the
  collected ARM inventory). Never present an `INFERRED` reference as a verified
  live connection.
- **`UNKNOWN`**: Uncollected or out-of-scope dependency layers that require
  running compute or code inspection:
  - Runtime table and column lineage (`system.access.table_lineage`,
    `system.access.column_lineage`), which require executing SQL on a running
    SQL Warehouse, and per-run or per-user DBU billing (`system.billing.usage`)
    unless the operator enabled it with `system_tables_warehouse_id` (off by
    default).
  - Dynamic paths, JDBC strings or table names embedded inside notebook,
    Python or JAR code.
  - Effective data-plane packet flow, DNS resolution and storage/Key Vault
    firewall ACL evaluation.

Never fabricate table lineage from job or notebook names, and never start a
cluster or SQL Warehouse to fill gaps.

## Report and four-file delivery

Make one complete call with `operation="report"` and other defaults except an
approved `workspace_name` or `workspace_names`. No local filter or paging
combination is valid for a report. **Immediately render all four provided
files**: HTML (`report_path`), full normalized JSON (`snapshot_path`), failed
findings CSV (`findings_csv_path`) and dependencies CSV
(`dependencies_csv_path`).

- For `sharing_mode="native_ui"`, render all four unchanged `*_url` values
  (`report_url`, `snapshot_url`, `findings_csv_url`, `dependencies_csv_url`) as
  native Markdown links/file widgets in the same response; the tool derives
  them from the verified SRE runtime thread directory. Never invent or reuse a
  host/thread/sandbox prefix. `http_verified=false` does not suppress these
  provided links; `artifact_status="written"` is not an HTTP download receipt.
- For `sharing_mode="local_files_only"`, expose the unchanged actual `*_path`
  values and state that `cwd` is outside the supported native runtime roots.
- On `status="error"`, report the sanitized `error.code`, `error.source_id` and
  `error.http_status` and stop. Do not claim completion, invent files, narrow
  scope, use ZIP/storage fallbacks or substitute a simulated report.

## Databricks costs (report section 6, `view="costs"`)

The cost section answers *where Databricks cost comes from and how to optimise
it*. It reads Azure Cost Management (amortized cost by default) for the
workspace resource and its managed resource group, grouped by the tags
Databricks puts on compute (`ClusterName`, `JobId`, `SqlEndpointId`,
`DatabricksInstancePoolId`, `Vendor`) and by the operator's allocation tags.

- Answer in this order: cost of the last closed month and its change, DBU vs
  infrastructure, the clusters, jobs, SQL warehouses and pools that concentrate
  it, the share no tag explains, then the top optimisation signals.
- Every saving is an estimate with a `saving_kind` (`lower_bound`,
  `upper_bound` or `estimate`) and a documented formula; say so, never promise
  it, and never add savings across signals of the same object (only rows with
  `counted=true` add up). Signals without a saving are "No estimable".
- The unattributed share is cost without the `Vendor` tag: shared workspace
  services and serverless DBUs, which carry no Azure tags. Explain it; do not
  spread it across teams.
- If `databricks_costs.status` is `denied`, say the identity needs Cost
  Management Reader on the subscription and show no figures; `partial` or
  `skipped` queries stay missing, never zero.
- Only when the user explicitly asks for a demo or a test without a workspace,
  call `operation="self_test"` with other defaults. Its four files come from a
  built-in workspace labelled `SIMULATED`; say so in the answer and never use it
  in place of a failed or unconfigured live run.

## Grounded questions

Use `operation="query"` with `view` in `summary`, `workspace`, `compute`,
`jobs`, `pipelines`, `warehouses`, `unity_catalog`, `resources`, `findings`,
`finops`, `costs`, `coverage`, `actions`, or `dependencies`.

- Use `classification` (`OBSERVED`, `INFERRED`, `UNKNOWN`) with
  `view="dependencies"` to filter the dependency graph by provenance.
- Use `workload_name` for exact local filtering by cluster, job, pipeline,
  warehouse, Unity Catalog object or resource name.
- Use `area`, `level`, `severity` and `status` only where documented.
- Honor exact `total_matched`, `returned`, `has_more`, `next_offset`,
  `transport_capped` and fresh-collection disclosure under the 3,500-byte
  default-serialized response budget.
- Scores are local assessment indicators, never an official Microsoft WAF or
  Databricks grade. Always report evaluated, `not_evaluated` (`No evaluado`) and
  `not_applicable` (`No aplica`) counts alongside any score.

## Never do

No Azure RBAC or Unity Catalog grants, no multi-tenant consent or federation
policy creation, no cluster or SQL Warehouse start/stop, no job or pipeline
runs, no `/api/2.0/sql/statements` execution other than the fixed billing
statement the operator enabled with `system_tables_warehouse_id`, no
`/api/2.0/secrets/get` calls, no export of `spark_env_vars`, `spark_conf`, init
script bodies, notebook code or job parameter values, no savings beyond the
tool's documented estimates and no fabricated lineage.
